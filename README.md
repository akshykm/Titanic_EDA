# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 5)
This project is part of a data analyst internship program. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships among various features, and gain insights about passenger survival.

## Files
* `Task5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Google colab Notebook containing all the EDA steps, visualizations, and insights.
* `titanic.csv`: Source dataset

## Objectives
* Load and understand the structure of the Titanic dataset.
* Handle missing values and data types.
* Perform univariate and bivariate analysis.
* Visualize relationships between key features and survival status.
* Draw conclusions and insights from the data.

## Key Analysis Steps
* Overview of dataset (shape, info, data types)
* Handling missing data (e.g., Age, Embarked)
* Distribution of features like Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex
* Survival rates by:
  * Gender
  * Passenger Class
  * Age groups
  * Embarked location
* Correlation matrix and heatmap
* Bar plots, histograms, boxplots, pie charts, and swarm plots

## Tools & Libraries Used
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Insights Summary
Some example insights from the notebook might include:
* Females had a higher survival rate than males.
* Passengers in 1st class had a much better chance of survival.
* Younger passengers had a slightly better survival rate.
* Port of embarkation also had an impact on survival outcomes.
